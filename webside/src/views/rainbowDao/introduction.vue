        Rainbow City belongs to DAO category, a virtual city-state of human civilization built based on blockchain, a
        country of liberty where we can truly Satoshi Nakamoto's thought and the spirit of Bitcoin into reality.
      </p>
      <p>
        In order
        to make Rainbow DAO more in line with the idea of blockchain, the spirit of Satoshi Nakamoto and mathematical
        algorithm, we invented a new separation of powers for humans based on mathematical algorithm with blockchain
        as
        the cornerstone.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the entire primary governance level, Rainbow DAO is composed of three parts: Rainbow City
        central council, Rainbow City central cabinet and Rainbow City central court. They restrict and coordinate
        with
        each other to escalate the entire ecosystem of Rainbow City.
      </p>
      <p>
        Rainbow City central council is the highest
        legislative body with the highest authority of the Rainbow city-state, owning the legislative power of the
        entire
        ecology, representing the overall interests of all members, safeguarding the collective right and guiding the
        healthy and orderly development of the entire ecology. It is divided into the House of Lords and the House of
        Commons. Specific institution regulations will be discussed according to the actual conditions in three to
        five
        years.
      </p>
      <p>
        Rainbow City central cabinet, as the highest administrative agency, has administrative power and
        responsibility in the concrete construction of the Rainbow city-state but subject to the supervision and
        inspection of the central parliament and the central court. Cabinet chairman, head of state, is endowed with
        veto
        power over projects in important proposals or decision-making adjustments and the power to dissolve central
        parliament and central court in crisis situations.
      </p>
      <p>
        While the cabinet chairman is under the supervision of the
        central parliament and the central court. On condition that they perceive that the chairman has committed any
        major negligence, the former can initiate impeachment against the chairman to safeguard the overall interests
        of
        the city-state. Similarly, provided that people deem that the chairman has committed any major negligence,
        they
        can release a referendum to remove the chairman from office and recall his veto power. It’s a system of checks
        and
        balances.

          <p>
            Rainbow City central court works as the highest judicial institution. Different from the court fabric,
            it consists of a row of smart contracts set in advance that penetrate all facets of Rainbow City governance
            to
            fend its fairness and justice there and assist senior judges in judicial interpretation. The detailed
            construction
            is yet undecided depending on the real-time situation of Rainbow DAO in the following three to five years
            and
            adjustments will be made as well.
          </p>
          <p>
            That is the separation of powers of Rainbow DAO, the core of the entire Rainbow
            DAO governance. Continuous optimization and adjustment will be made relying on the development of Rainbow
            ecology.
          </p>
          <p>
            Specially targeting the strengths and weaknesses of blockchain projects, Rainbow DAO employs due system:
            intensive
            management + strong community, which are the two wings of the Rainbow central cabinet body.
          </p>
          <p>
            One body refers to
            Rainbow central cabinet as a whole; two wings, two major components, that is, Rainbow founding and
            management
            team
            and community team. They take on the administrative executive function of the sector in two dimensions. As
            Rainbow
            ecosystem grows stronger, the two will finally merged into one and rise to be the real central cabinet of
            Rainbow
            City.

                <div class="content">
                  RBT itself comes with a smart contract with a "taxation" function. When users transfer RBT on
                  Ethereum,
                  they need to be deducted a certain handling fee as tax. The tax rate is between 0% and 1%. The initial
                  tax rate is 0.5%, and Rainbow DAO will vote to determine the tax rate change. The faster the RBT
                  velocity, the higher the tax revenue. This part of the income belongs to the most basic income of the
                  RBT ecology. At the same time, the tax protocol adds a whitelist function, which can set different tax
                  rates for different protocols within the whitelist range. The highest tax rate is 1%, and the lowest
                  is

            FIVE RIGHTS OF RAINBOW CITY
          </div>
          <div class="page-content" @wheel.stop>
            <p>
              As what was mentioned earlier, Rainbow City divides the world into 18 regions. For each of them, when 10
              urban
              governance committee DAOs are set, then this area can activate its only one regional governance committee
              DAO
              and establish its core management texture such as Central Bank, Central Court and Cabinet, etc.
            </p>
            <p>
            <p>
              When each
              community member joins Rainbow DAO, he is simultaneously choosing to join a certain city node DAO and all
              his
              subsequent economic behaviors will be bound together with this city node DAO. The most prominent feature of
              Rainbow DAO is that DAO at diverse levels will have a certain percentage of fiscal revenue as the financial
              public management fund of this organization. Hence, this DAO obtains its independent financial revenue right
              and proposal execution right.
            </p>
            <p>
              With independent financial right, every subordinate DAO grow capable of
              conducting community autonomy, which is one of the most valuable contributions that Rainbow DAO brings to
              the
              entire blockchain world. It truly delegates financial right to community, subverting the distribution
              relationship of an economy with a brand-new production relationship and distribution model.

              Depending on the VIP level, the extension rewards that

              users are 40%, silver users are 60%, gold users are 80%, and platinum users are 100%.
