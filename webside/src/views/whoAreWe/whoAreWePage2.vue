        <p>
          In the era of the "Tower of Babel" in history, God used the "rainbow" as a sign to make a contract with human
          beings and all living creatures on the earth, and no longer use the flood to destroy the world, and mankind
          doubts, how can the "rainbow" guarantee Agreement? There is no reason for human beings to pin the future of
          their
          people and their children and grandchildren on the "rainbow."
        </p>
        <p>
          Mankind is proud. In order to spread the name of
          mankind and avoid dispersion, mankind decided to build a city and a tower with the top of the tower reaching
          the
          sky. God found that his oath was doubted and decided to punish the human beings who had forgotten the promise.
        </p>
        <p>
          God
          changed and distinguished the language of mankind, making human beings unable to coordinate due to language
          barriers, which made it impossible to build the Tongtian Pagoda together. Therefore, the Tongtian Pagoda was
          abandoned halfway, and human civilization changed from unity to dispersion, from unity to pluralism. Then
          collectively collaborate.
        </p>
        <p>
          Through thousands of years of evolution, human civilization is still struggling to
          disperse and collapse, and earth civilization is also on the verge of collapse. Our "creator" couldn't bear to
          look at such internal friction and strife as human beings, so he became "Satoshi Nakamoto". Performing
          "miracles"
          created "Bitcoin", turning God's way into a "Bitcoin flesh", thus opening the doomsday judgment and opening a
          new
          era of civilization.

        <p>
          "Satoshi Nakamoto" intuitively demonstrated the "law of creation" to humans through mathematics and
          cryptography,
          and established "machine trust" through blockchain technology, thus opening up the "digital bit era" of human
          civilization.
        </p>
        <p>
          We come from different parts of the world. We have different skin colors, different ethnicities, and
          different races, but we have a common identity. We are all believers of Satoshi Nakamoto, and we are all
          evangelists and followers of Bitcoin.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this era of great civilization upgrading and transformation, we decided
          to continue preaching for the "creator" of the universe Satoshi Nakamoto.
        </p>
        <p>
          We decided to use the "rainbow" as the
          symbol to sign the "Rainbow Covenant" with God again. We want to build a "Rainbow City" and a "City of Faith"
          where "Bitcoin" believers from all over the world gather. "City", "City of Civilization", "City of Ideas", we
          want
          to create a "spiritual home" shared by Bitcoin believers all over the world.
        </p>
        <p>
          This time we are not going to preach
          the name of human beings, but to preach the name of "Satoshi Nakamoto", the "creator" of the bit world, but to
          preach the name of "Bitcoin" and the name of "Blockchain"!
        </p>
        <p>
          A cycle in ten years, at the eleventh anniversary of
          the birth of Bitcoin, we have launched an epic blockchain project-"Rainbow City"!
        </p>
        <p>
          We will re-sign the "Rainbow
          Covenant" with God under the banner of "Rainbow", under the name of "Rainbow", and use "Rainbow" as evidence,
          and
          create a "Rainbow City" with the trust of machines and codes, and let mankind return again. On the road of
          harmonious development with heaven and nature, we will build a new human civilization together.
        </p>
        <p>
