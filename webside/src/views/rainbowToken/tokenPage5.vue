        RBT RAINBOW TOKEN ISSUANCE, <br/>LOCK-UP AND RELEASE RULES
      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="page-content" @wheel.stop>
      <p>
        The Rainbow City ecosystem creates DAO——decentralized autonomous organization, which refers to the design of a
        series of open and fair rules through blockchain technology and economic incentive models, so that business
        activities can be managed without human intervention and management. This is the mission that "Rainbow City" is
        going to fulfill. In this system, the most important thing is the rules for the distribution and use of tokens,
        and whether this rule is transparent and trustworthy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore, we have formulated this "RBT Rainbow Token Issuance, Lock Position and Release Rules". This set of
        rules is open and fair, and at the same time accepts the supervision of the entire community. Under the
        supervision of the community, the entire ecosystem can gradually realize autonomous operation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Based on this rule, we not only set the original distribution plan, but more importantly, set the "scope of
        use", "lock release period" and "principle of use" for each module. This will be the basic law of our rainbow
        community to guide the entire community to move forward in a stable and orderly manner.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this rule, we not only set the original distribution plan, but more
        importantly, set the "scope of use", "lock release cycle" and "principle of use" for each module. This will be
        the basic law of our rainbow community to guide the entire community to move forward in a stable and orderly
        manner.
