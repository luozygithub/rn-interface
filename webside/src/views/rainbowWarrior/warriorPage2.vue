      <div class="content">
        In a solemn gathering ceremony for the elders of all the indigenous tribes of the Maya in November 1995, the
        Mayan elder Don Alejandro of Guatemala announced an exciting news: "The Rainbow Warrior is about to be born!"
        What is a rainbow warrior? This goes back to an ancient prophecy passed down from generation to generation by
        the Maya. The prophecy said: People with light skin (white people) will log in and conquer the Indians from the
        East Coast of America. Later, due to people's endless desire for material things, the situation on the earth
        became worse and worse, and the Indians were almost helpless to deal with these disasters. But at this time, a
        new dawn appeared in the East, and the Indians regained strength, self-esteem and wisdom. The prophecy said that
        together with many light-skinned brothers and sisters, they began to work hard to change the earth. Under the
        banner of the rainbow, people of all races and all faiths will unite to spread the concept that humans should
        live in harmony with nature. People with this consciousness will become "rainbow warriors"! Although they are
        called warriors, they have inherited the spirit of their ancestors. They have the brilliance of wisdom in their
        minds and the power of compassion in their hearts. They will not harm any life. The prophecy said that when they
        come back, they will also bring a new belief similar to religion. They punish evil and promote good, and unify
        the world. The "Rainbow Warriors" through non-violent fierce struggle finally stopped the destruction and
        disintegration of the earth. Peace and prosperity rule the world for a long time, and the golden age of joy and
        harmony has finally come to the world.
        The above is the prediction of the "Rainbow Warrior" in the Mayan prophecy. Isn't this the belief and mission of
        the future "Rainbow Warrior" of our "Rainbow City"? Isn't this the prophecy of the Christian Bible about the
        "end times" and "New Jerusalem"? After thousands of years of evolution, human civilization is still struggling
        on the verge of fragmentation and collapse, until the mysterious Satoshi Nakamoto created Bitcoin in 2009, which
        opened a new era, and human civilization began to enter the "digital bit era". In this era of great
        civilizational change, we, a group of Satoshi Nakamoto believers, specially initiated the establishment of the
        "Rainbow City" project. We decided to re-establish a "contract" with God, once again using "Rainbow" as the
        agreement, we must recreate "Babel" "Tower" to build the "Rainbow City", but this time we are not going to
        preach the name of human beings, but to preach the name of "Satoshi Nakamoto", the "creator" of the bit world.
        We want to make another contract with God in the name of "Rainbow", and the "Rainbow City" we created this time
        is a bit civilized digital city-state based on token economy and community governance. In the "Rainbow City"
        ecosystem, we will Issue "Rainbow Token—Rainbow Token" and “Rainbow Coin—Rainbow Currency”. Regardless of
        community members who own “Rainbow Token” or “Rainbow Currency”, we will call them “Rainbow Warriors”, and
        “Rainbow Coins”. The consensus that "Rainbow Warriors" want to defend is the consensus of heaven that man and
        nature live in harmony! The establishment of "Rainbow City" is to re-sign the "Rainbow Covenant" with God and
        practice the "Consensus of Heaven". In the future, the "Rainbow Warrior" of Rainbow City will truly grow into
        the "Rainbow Warrior" in the Mayan prophecy. "Warriors" will adhere to the agreement between mankind and God,
        read God's revelation with "heart", realize the awakening of spirit and consciousness, and support and
        understand God's "laws of nature." Under the banner of "Rainbow", people of all races and all faiths will unite
        to spread the idea that human beings should live in harmony with nature. People with this consciousness can
        become "Rainbow Warriors"! The "Rainbow Warrior" will also evolve into a new human who can resonate with the
        consciousness of the universe, and together promote the earth's civilization into the fourth dimension!
